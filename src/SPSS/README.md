A directory of files using SPSS to do data wrangling and supplementary analysis.

With one exception, these supplementary analyses can be recreated using the same two data files as the R main analyses:
MERGE_NR_2.3.21.sav and TPL_Testing_Survey_FifthWave_YouGov_MERGEDWITHFOURTHWAVEFORMESSING.sav

The exception: the accuracy analysis uses data from the US Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey, which is publicly available at
https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/datasets.html (data set: pulse2021_puf_27).
